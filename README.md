# Minesweeper

There are 4 versions of minesweepers I have made.  
minesweeper.cpp and m2inesweeper.cpp do not need any other files to function properly, whereas minesweeper.py and m2inesweeper.py need to be in the same directory as menu.py and the assets folder.

NOTE: The assets folder doesn't work because the necessary actions that lead to being able to upload .png and .mp3 files are currently unknown to me.
