# Minesweeper

It all started when I learned the rules of this game and wanted to try it. Turns out my PC didn't have Minesweeper built-in. So I made my own copy. I made more versions of it with better implementations and more features as a got better at programming.

I'm not very familiar with GitHub so this repository will have to stay as a mess for a while.  
i'll fix it i promise
